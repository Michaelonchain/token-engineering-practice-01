# Token Engineering Practice 01

This repository documents a hands-on token engineering practice exercise
focused on designing a sustainable token model for a Web3 protocol.

The goal is to practice real-world token design thinking, not speculation
or price prediction.

## Project Overview

Protocol Name: FlowPay  
Use Case: Decentralized payment protocol

The token is used for:
- Paying transaction fees
- Staking by validators
- Governance participation

---

## Design Goals

- Strong network security
- Predictable and declining inflation
- Long-term incentive alignment
- Reduced short-term sell pressure

---

## Key Takeaway

Token design is behavior design.
If incentives are misaligned, the token fails regardless of marketing.
