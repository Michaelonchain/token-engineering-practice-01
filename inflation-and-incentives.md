# Inflation & Incentive Design

## Inflation Schedule

The protocol uses a declining inflation model:

- Year 1: 5%
- Year 2: 4%
- Year 3: 3%
- Year 4: 2%
- Year 5: 1%

Declining inflation supports early growth while reducing long-term dilution.

## Emission Allocation

Annual emissions are distributed as follows:
- Validators: 70%
- Active users: 30%

Validators receive a larger share due to their role in securing the network.

## Locking Mechanisms

To reduce sell pressure:
- Rewards require token locking (30–90 days)
- Longer lockups earn higher rewards
- Early unlocks incur penalties

This discourages mercenary behavior and promotes long-term participation.
